This repostiory provides an implemention of the backpropagation algorithm for fully-connected
neural networks. It is meant to serve as an illustration for students studying the algorithm.

**Visualize backpropagation**

I also provide a tool to visuale training. See the following video as an example (for the uncompressed
files, see ".mp4" files in "videos/").
