# Visualizing backpropagation

This repostiory provides 

1. A **visualization** tool for neural networks 
2. A visualization tool for the **training** of neural networks giving illustrative videos.
3. An implementation of the backpropagation algorithm for fully connected neural networks.


## 1. Visualizing neural networks

This function is integrated in the 'visualize_neural_nets.py' file.

## 2. Visualizing neural networks

We also provide a tool to visuale training (see gif above) which illustrates gradient updates 
and change of weights. For the full video, see https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57487578/109711025-4c478b00-7b96-11eb-8f77-c13cc3f1ede1.mp4.
This function is integrated in the 'train_mlp.py' file.

## 3. Backpropagation algorithm


## Data 

As an illustration, we extracted a small subset from the MNIST dataset consisting of 7's and 9's.
