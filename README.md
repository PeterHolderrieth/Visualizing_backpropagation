This repostiory provides an implemention of the backpropagation algorithm for fully-connected
neural networks. It is meant to serve as an illustration for students studying the algorithm.

**Visualize backpropagation**

I also provide a tool to visuale training. See the following video as an example (for the full
file, see [this link] https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57487578/109711025-4c478b00-7b96-11eb-8f77-c13cc3f1ede1.mp4.
